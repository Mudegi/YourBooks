## Usage in Seeding Engine

### Simple Iteration Example

```typescript
import { getAccountTemplates } from '@/lib/coa-generator';

// Get all retail accounts (base + retail-specific)
const retailAccounts = getAccountTemplates('RETAIL', true);

// Iterate and create in database
for (const account of retailAccounts) {
  await prisma.chartOfAccount.create({
    data: {
      organizationId: organization.id,
      code: account.code,
      name: account.name,
      accountType: account.accountType,
      accountSubType: account.accountSubType,
      description: account.description,
      isSystem: account.isSystem ?? false,
      isActive: true,
      balance: 0,
      currency: organization.baseCurrency,
    },
  });
  
  console.log(`✓ Created ${account.code} - ${account.name}`);
}
```

### Using the COA Generator

```typescript
import { generateChartOfAccounts } from '@/lib/coa-generator';

// Automatically generates all 54 accounts for retail
const result = await generateChartOfAccounts({
  organizationId: 'org_retail_123',
  industryType: 'RETAIL',
  baseCurrency: 'USD',
  includeOptionalAccounts: true,
});

console.log(`Created ${result.accountsCreated} retail accounts`);
// Output: Created 54 retail accounts
```
